  "0": "The tree wife\n",
  "1":"Once upon a time, there lived a man who had plenty of everything – a large fertile farm, with cattle, sheep, and goats.\nBut, as he grew old, he grew sad, because one thing was missing. He did not have a wife.\n",
  "2":"Standing under a tree one day, he had a brilliant idea.\nIf he couldn’t find a wife, perhaps he could make one?\n",
  "3":"So he set to work to shape a beautiful woman from a strong branch of the tree. When he had finished making the statue, he touched her eyes, and they opened.\nHe blew gently on her, and she came alive.\n",
  "4":"She was truly the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.\nHe knelt before her, and asked her to be his wife.\n",
  "5":"He gave her a colourful apron, beads, and a head ring, the sign of a married woman. And he built her a house with the mud and grass that used to lie at the foot of her trunk.\n“Only one thing I beg of you,” he said to his wife. “Never tell anyone where you come from.”\n",
  "6":"But before long, the young men from a neighbouring village began talking among themselves.\n“How can such an old man have such a beautiful young wife?”\nSo they decided to steal her and take her to their own kraal.\n",
  "7":"The old man was heartbroken. He felt he could not live without her.\nBut then he thought, “Perhaps if I have something of hers, I would not feel so sad?”\nSo he sent his doves to find her, to sing to her, and to bring back something of hers to him.\n",
  "8":"When they found her, they sang to her in the language of birds.\n\"Tree woman, tree woman. More beautiful than any other. Your husband has sent us. To bring back your apron!\"\n",
  "9":"She gave them her apron, and they flew over the hill, over the river, back to her husband. He held the apron to his face, and was comforted for a little while.\n",
  "10":"But his longing did not go away.\nSo again he sent his doves to sing to her:\nTree woman, tree woman\nMore beautiful than any other\nYour husband has sent us\nTo bring back your head ring!\nAnd back they flew with the head ring, the sign of a married woman.\n",
  "11":"He held the head ring and sighed for his wife, far away in the kraal of other people.\nAfter a while, he called his doves again. He told them to go to her and sing:\nTree woman, tree woman\nMore beautiful than any other\nYour husband has sent us\nTo bring back your life!\n",
  "12":"So away they went the third time.\nThey perched on her shoulders. As they sang, each bird pecked out an eye.\nImmediately she turned again into a statue. Her feet and arms fell away. Then her head. And she fell to the ground.\n",
  "13":"Her husband slowly rolled her wooden trunk to the river. He stood her up with her roots in the water. Nourished by sun and soil, she grew leaves again.\n",
  "14":"And when the wind blows, the leaves sigh.\nJust as a woman does when she longs for her husband.\n",
